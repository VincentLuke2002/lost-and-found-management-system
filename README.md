Copy the `lostfound` folder into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory:

```text
C:/xampp/htdocs/lostfound/
```

### 3. Create Upload Directories

Create these folders manually. They are excluded from the repository:

```text
C:/xampp/htdocs/lostfound/uploads/lost_items/
C:/xampp/htdocs/lostfound/uploads/found_items/
C:/xampp/htdocs/lostfound/uploads/claims/
```

### 4. Import the Database

1. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** in the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
3. Create a new database named `lostfound_db`.
4. Click **Import** and select `database/schema.sql`.
5. Click **Go**.

### 5. Configure Database Connection

Open `config/database.php` and update if needed:

```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'lostfound_db');
define('DB_USER', 'root');
define('DB_PASS', '');  // Set your MySQL password if applicable
```

### 6. Configure Base URL

```php
define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/lostfound');
define('BASE_PATH', 'C:/xampp/htdocs/lostfound');

### 7. Set Admin Password

Run this SQL in phpMyAdmin to set a secure admin password:

```sql
UPDATE users

WHERE email = 'admin@lostfound.local';
```

Or log in with the default credentials below and change the password through User Management.

## User Roles

| Role | Access Level |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full access — manage users, categories, locations, approve claims, view all reports |
| **Staff** | Record found items, update item status, review and approve or reject claims |
| **User** | Report lost items, view found items, submit claims, track own claim status |

---

## Database Schema

The system uses 10 database tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | User accounts with role assignments |
| `roles` | Role definitions: admin, staff, user |
| `lost_items` | Lost item records with owner info and status |
| `found_items` | Found item records with storage location |
| `categories` | Item categories such as Electronics, Wallets, Keys, and more |
| `locations` | Campus or facility locations |
| `claims` | Ownership claims with proof and evidence |
| `item_matches` | Auto-generated and confirmed matches between lost and found items |
| `notifications` | In-app notification records per user |
| `activity_logs` | Full audit trail of all user actions |

---

## Matching Algorithm

The matching engine scores lost items against found items across five criteria:

| Criteria | Points |
|---|---:|
| Same category | 30 |
| Same location | 20 |
| Found date is after lost date | 10 |
| Item name word overlap | Up to 25 |
| Description keyword overlap | Up to 15 |

Items scoring **40 or above** are surfaced as suggested matches. Staff can confirm or dismiss each suggestion. Confirmed matches update the lost item status to `matched` and notify the original reporter.

---

## Reports

Five report types are available under the Reports module:

| Report Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Lost Items** | All lost item records filtered by date range |
| **Found Items** | All found item records filtered by date range |
| **Claims** | All claim submissions filtered by date range |
| **By Category** | Item distribution breakdown per category with percentage bars |
| **Monthly Summary** | 6-month comparison of lost vs found counts with visual bars |

All reports support **CSV export**, Excel-compatible UTF-8 BOM formatting, and **browser print** with the sidebar automatically hidden.

---

## Security

| Security Area | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Database Access | All database queries use PDO prepared statements |
| Passwords | Hashed with BCrypt using `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` and cost factor 12 |
| Form Protection | CSRF tokens on every POST form |
| Output Safety | XSS prevention through `htmlspecialchars()` wrapper `e()` |
| Upload Security | MIME type validation, extension whitelist, and 5MB size limit |
| Upload Hardening | PHP execution blocked in the `uploads/` directory through `.htaccess` |
| Directory Protection | Direct access to `config/`, `includes/`, and `database/` blocked through `.htaccess` |
| Sessions | Cookies use `httponly` and `samesite=Strict` |
| Authorization | Role checks enforced server-side on every protected page |
